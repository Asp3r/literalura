## Project Description

This Java application (with Spring Boot implementation) was created as one of the final projects of the "Spring Boot and Databases" module of the "Back-End Programming with Java" course from Alura ONE (a course provided as a product of the alliance between Alura and Oracle ONE). The function of this small console program is to search for data of a specific book on the web, using the Gutendex API (https://gutendex.com/), and save data of said book, as well as its author, in a database (Said database is not provided in this repository for security reasons), thus allowing access to this data in a practical and fast way in the future.

## Tools Used

Literalura was developed using the following technologies:

* Java (the base language in which the application was written)
* Spring Boot (Java framework that facilitates the creation of standalone, production-ready applications)
* PostgreSQL (database management system used)
* pgAdmin 4 (tool for managing and reviewing the PostgreSQL database)

## Future Plans

This program is planned to be improved with future updates. The main improvements intended to be added are:  
  
* Making the console menu more user-friendly, specifically in the selection of many options, such as the selection of languages in the language filter menu.  
* Adding a couple more validations and correctly managing Exceptions that were not considered in the first version of Literalura.  
* Restructuring the Author and Book classes to create two related tables with a foreign key, instead of just two unrelated tables.  
* Making the program available in English instead of just Spanish. Possibly adding a language selection option for the program.  
  
Disclaimer: Although all these improvements are planned to be made and are expected to happen in the future, there is no scheduled date or clear timestamps. The program will be updated as the availability of my other projects allows.
